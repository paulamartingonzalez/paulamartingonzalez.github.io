  As a last year PhD student in computational biology, I have developed expertise in image analysis and biomedical data science - including graph learning and genomics analysis . I have a strong foundation in technical subjects, and I am able to use this knowledge to tackle complex problems in healthcare.

  Throughout my doctoral studies, I have worked on a variety of projects involving the analysis of biological images - radiology and pathology - and the development of algorithms to extract valuable information from these images. I have also conducted research on machine learning algorithms and their applications in genomics, including the analysis of non-coding regions of the genome and the use of functional assays. 

  In addition to my technical skills, I am a curious and creative problem solver who is passionate about using data science to advance our understanding of biology and improve patient care. I am excited to continue pursuing these goals as I enter the job market and seek opportunities to apply my skills in a professional setting.
